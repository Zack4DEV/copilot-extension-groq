# GitHub Copilot Extension with Cloud Groq Integration
![Copilot for Business and Groq Integration](./src/assets/image/Copilot.png)

About
This project introduces a GitHub Copilot Extension integrated with Cloud Groq APIs , utilizing powerful AI models such as qwen-2.5-32b, deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b, and gemma2-9b-it. It enables developers to interact seamlessly with advanced AI capabilities directly from their development environments, offering a comprehensive set of tools to optimize workflows and enhance productivity.

The solution leverages both Cloud Groq 's scalable AI infrastructure and GitHub Copilot's intelligent coding assistance to create a robust, extensible, and interactive experience for developers.

---

## Purpose
This integration is designed to:
- Empower developers with real-time AI model insights .
- Streamline code generation workflows .
- Automate repetitive tasks like code reviews , model execution , and recommendations .
- Provide enterprises with customized AI-driven tools tailored to their needs.

It combines Cloud Groq’s model API with a GitHub Copilot extension , offering flexibility for private or public publishing (e.g., on the GitHub Marketplace).

## Used Technologies
- [GitHub Copilot Extension SDK](https://github.com/features/copilot) : Enables building custom Copilot extensions for seamless IDE interaction.
- [Cloud Groq API](https://groq.com/) : Provides access to advanced AI models with scalable performance.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) : For containerized deployment of the extension.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) : Automates CI/CD workflows, including Docker builds.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) : The primary language for the extension, ensuring type-safe development.
- Other Dependencies :
  - @copilot-extensions/preview-sdk: For building and testing Copilot extensions.
  - tsx: Provides a seamless developer experience with TypeScript in Node.js.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality: code generation, summarization, or analysis with specific models.

### Integration with GitHub Copilot:
- Use Copilot commands (e.g., /listModels, /describeModel) directly within the IDE.
- Provide context-aware suggestions and recommendations for enhancing workflows.

### Enterprise-Ready:
- Deployment options for private enterprise use (Docker-based).
- Full compatibility with GitHub organizational features.

## Launch Instructions
1. Set Up Dependencies :
   - Install Node.js and TypeScript globally:
     bash
     npm install typescript -g
     
   - Install required dependencies:
     bash
     npm install
     

2. Build the Project :
   - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
     bash
     npm run build
     

3. Run Locally :
   - Start the app locally for development:
     ```bash
     npm start

4. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Build and run the container:
     bash
     docker build -t copilot-extension-groq .
     docker run -p 8080:8080 copilot-extension-groq
     

5. **Publish to GitHub Marketplace**:
   - Create an app listing using GitHub's documentation:
     [GitHub Marketplace Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps).
   - Alternatively, keep the project private by using enterprise GitHub repositories and access controls.

## **GitHub Actions**
Automate the build and deployment process using **GitHub Actions**. Example workflow (`dockertag.yml`):
yaml
name: Docker CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build TypeScript
      run: npm run build

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t zack4dev/copilot-extension-groq .

    - name: Push Docker image
      run: docker push zack4dev/copilot-extension-groq
```

## Business Use Cases
- For Individual Developers :
  - Get recommendations for LLMs based on input tasks.
  - Use AI models like qwen-2.5-32b to optimize coding workflows.
  
- For Enterprises :
  - Deploy private instances for large-scale projects.
  - Integrate enterprise policy management for Copilot commands.

---

## Future Roadmap
1. Enhanced Features :
   - Integrate additional AI models (e.g., Codex, Claude).
   - Add features like multi-language support and syntax auto-fixes.
2. Analytics Dashboard :
   - Monitor usage statistics and optimize API calls.
3. Expand Deployment :
   - Publish on Azure Marketplace and GitHub Marketplace.
